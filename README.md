**Food Chain System Smart Contract Overview**

The "food_chain_system" module is a smart contract written in the Move programming language, designed to facilitate a decentralized food chain system. It introduces functionalities for managing products, consumers, complaints, and dispute resolutions within the food supply chain. Below is a detailed documentation of its components, purpose, features, setup, and interaction.

**Purpose:**
The primary purpose of the "food_chain_system" module is to establish a transparent and efficient food supply chain system on a decentralized platform. It aims to ensure trust, fairness, and accountability among suppliers and consumers by providing mechanisms for product listing, ordering, complaints filing, and dispute resolution.

**Features:**
1. **Product Management:** Suppliers can create new products for sale, specifying attributes such as description, quality, price, and duration. Consumers can view and order available products.
2. **Consumer Management:** Suppliers can add consumers with specific requirements for products, enabling targeted marketing and personalized offerings.
3. **Order Handling:** Consumers can place orders for products, and suppliers can choose consumers to fulfill orders and process payments.
4. **Complaints Handling:** Consumers can file complaints against suppliers for issues such as product quality or non-delivery within the specified deadline.
5. **Dispute Resolution:** An admin or arbitrator can resolve disputes between consumers and suppliers, ensuring fair outcomes and appropriate actions.

**Setup:**
The setup process involves installing necessary dependencies, configuring local networks, minting tokens, and deploying the smart contract. It includes steps such as installing Rust and Cargo, setting up SUI binaries, running a local network, configuring SUI Wallet (optional), and interacting with the contract via command-line interface (CLI).

**Interaction:**
After setting up the environment and deploying the smart contract, users can interact with it through various CLI commands. These commands include creating new products, adding consumers, placing orders, filing complaints, and resolving disputes. Each interaction follows a specific protocol, involving parameters such as product IDs, descriptions, quantities, and timestamps.

Overall, the "food_chain_system" smart contract module provides a robust framework for establishing and managing a decentralized food supply chain system. It promotes transparency, fairness, and accountability while ensuring the smooth flow of products from suppliers to consumers.
